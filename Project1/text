Project 1

Description: 

Project 1 creates a symbol table to be used by pass 1 and pass 2(projects 3 and 4) for systems software
A file is to be read at command line. 
A hash table is used to store the data if the data input is in the format of String Int. Will report if the data has
already been stored.
If the data input is only a String then a search function is used to find the data and gives a error if it can't find it.

Input: a text file using Scanner

Output: Tells the user where the data was stored, if you are trying to store the same data, where you can find the data,
and if the data you searched for is not in the hash table.
